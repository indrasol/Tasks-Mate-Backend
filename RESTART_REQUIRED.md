# Backend Restart Required

## New Organization Profile API

The Organization Profile API endpoints have been added but require a backend server restart to become active.

### New Endpoints Added:
- `GET /v1/organizations/profile/{org_id}` - Get organization profile
- `PUT /v1/organizations/profile/{org_id}` - Update organization profile  
- `POST /v1/organizations/profile/{org_id}` - Create organization profile
- `DELETE /v1/organizations/profile/{org_id}` - Delete organization profile

### To Enable:

1. **Stop the current backend server** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Install missing dependency** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install sendgrid
   ```

3. **Restart the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. **Verify the endpoints are working**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/organizations/profile/O0003" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

### Frontend Fallback

The frontend has been designed to gracefully handle the case where the API endpoints are not yet available:

- ✅ Shows default empty profile structure
- ✅ Displays helpful welcome messages for empty profiles  
- ✅ Allows organization owners to start building their profile
- ✅ Provides user-friendly error messages when API is not available

The Organization Profile tab will work immediately with placeholder content, and will automatically connect to the backend API once the server is restarted.
